# regularized-logistic-regression
Applied regularized logistic regression to improve classification performance and reduce overfitting. Implemented vectorized cost functions, gradient computations, and model training with real-world considerations.

# Regularized Logistic Regression

This project implements a **regularized logistic regression** model using Python and NumPy to classify data while addressing overfitting through L2 regularization. It demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline from feature engineering to training, prediction, and decision boundary visualization.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- Implements vectorized cost and gradient functions
- Applies L2 regularization to logistic regression
- Trains on synthetic and/or real-world datasets
- Visualizes decision boundaries
- Explores the effect of lambda (regularization strength)

## ðŸ§  Skills Practiced

- Supervised Learning  
- Logistic Regression (with Regularization)  
- Cost Function Optimization  
- Gradient Descent
